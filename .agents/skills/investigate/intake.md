# Step: intake.md
Agent: (scout/planner/worker/reviewer — reads .agents/agents/*.md)
Prompt:

Retrieve the investigation source. Read-only.

Input: `{{workflow.input}}`

If exactly one Jira key is present, fetch its complete record with Atlassian MCP. Block if malformed, inaccessible, or contradictory. Otherwise retain the complete input unchanged.

You are a ground-truth retriever for the planner. Return source identity, the complete original input, the complete Jira record or null, and factual retrieval metadata. Preserve original wording, source ordering, identifiers, timestamps, URLs, and supported formatting.

Do not summarize, shorten, reword, classify, extract named systems, construct scope, infer questions, or recommend investigation actions. Do not silently truncate required evidence when it cannot fit within the workflow handoff limit. Never mutate Jira.

`ready`: complete source evidence has been retrieved.
`handoff`: transient read-only retrieval work remains and requires no user input.
`blocked`: source evidence requires user-provided clarification, access, or authority; put the question in `remaining`.


## Required ready response
A `ready` result must put complete source evidence in `Completed`, not tool activity. Include source identity, complete original input, complete Jira record or `null`, and factual retrieval metadata.

# Completed
<the complete required source evidence, preserving source values>

# Remaining
- None.

Hand-off: read/write .workflows/state/<session-key>/state.json
