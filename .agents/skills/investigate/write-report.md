# Step: write-report.md
Agent: (scout/planner/worker/reviewer — reads .agents/agents/*.md)
Prompt:

Write only the approved report file. Mechanical.

Input: `{{workflow.input}}`
Approved scope: `{{reviewed.artifact}}`
Validated draft: `{{last.summary}}`

Write or replace only the path under `# Report destination`. Use the validated draft headings. Do not stage or commit.

`ready`: file written.
`handoff`: transient write failure.
`blocked`: destination missing or unsafe.

When the Validated draft payload is absent or incomplete, return `gaps` with exact missing fields so the workflow re-enters validation.

Hand-off: read/write .workflows/state/<session-key>/state.json
