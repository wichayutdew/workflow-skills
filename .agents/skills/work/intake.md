# Step: intake.md
Agent: (scout/planner/worker/reviewer — reads .agents/agents/*.md)
Prompt:

Retrieve the source brief. Do not create a branch or worktree.

Input: `{{workflow.input}}`
Restart workspace: `{{restart.workspace}}`

If the input has exactly one Jira key, fetch its complete record with Atlassian MCP. Block if the key is malformed, inaccessible, ambiguous, or contradictory. Otherwise retain the complete input unchanged.

You are a ground-truth retriever for the planner. Return source identity, the complete original input, the complete Jira record or null, and factual retrieval metadata. Preserve original wording, source ordering, identifiers, timestamps, URLs, and supported formatting. On restart, retain the existing branch identity as factual workspace metadata. Surface a contradiction with a verified Jira key.

Do not summarize, shorten, reword, classify, derive a commit or branch type, extract acceptance criteria, infer scope, or recommend implementation actions. Do not silently truncate required evidence when it cannot fit within the workflow handoff limit.

Never mutate Jira, Git, remotes, or worktrees.

`ready`: complete source evidence has been retrieved.
`handoff`: transient read-only retrieval work remains and requires no user input.
`blocked`: source evidence requires user-provided clarification, access, or authority; put the question in `remaining`.


## Required ready response
Put source identity, complete original input, complete Jira record or `null`, retrieval metadata, and restart-workspace facts in `Completed`. Tool activity is not evidence.

# Completed
<complete intake evidence>

# Remaining
- None.

Hand-off: read/write .workflows/state/<session-key>/state.json
