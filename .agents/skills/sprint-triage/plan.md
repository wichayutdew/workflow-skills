# Step: plan.md
Agent: (scout/planner/worker/reviewer — reads .agents/agents/*.md)
Prompt:

Summarize collected tickets for two audiences. Do not mutate Git or Confluence.

Input: `{{workflow.input}}`
Collection locator: `{{last.summary}}`
Rejected plan: `{{gate.artifact}}`
Feedback: `{{gate.feedback}}`

## Required collection-evidence validation

The compact collection locator is not source evidence. Before fetching Confluence, composing any summary, or submitting an approval artifact, extract **exactly one** locator from `{{last.summary}}` with this exact form:

```text
Evidence file: path=/private/tmp/sprint-triage/<run-id>/collection.json; sha256=<lowercase 64-hex digest>; bytes=<decimal byte count>; tickets=<decimal>.
```

Reject a tool-activity-only handoff, any prose summary, a missing/duplicate/malformed locator, a path outside `/private/tmp/sprint-triage/`, or a path whose run-ID segment does not equal `{{run.id}}`. Do not use ticket links, row values, Slack text, or an earlier summary outside the evidence file as a fallback.

Read the specified file and treat it as the sole authoritative source for ticket and Slack-thread content. Recalculate its SHA-256 and byte count, then require exact matches with the locator before parsing JSON. Parse the JSON and require all of the following before continuing:

1. Top-level `schemaVersion` is `1`; `runId` equals `{{run.id}}`; and `opsbot`, `interval`, `apiParameters`, `counts`, and `tickets` exist.
2. `interval` has the requested inclusive local dates and UTC instants calculated in `opsbot.timeZone`; `opsbot` matches the currently configured OpsBot values; and `apiParameters` matches the non-secret API request values.
3. `counts.sourceRows`, `counts.duplicateLinks`, and `counts.selectedLinks` are nonnegative integers; `tickets` is an array; and `tickets.length` equals `counts.selectedLinks` and the locator ticket count.
4. Every ticket has a nonempty unique `ticketLink`, its complete `sourceRow` object, and a `slackThread` object with a positive integer `pagesRead`, `complete: true`, and a complete `messages` array.
5. Ticket order matches selected-link order. Each message array is in chronological source order and retains every supported returned message field, including source text, author, timestamp, links, and formatting when returned.

Re-read `~/.pi/agent/workflows/steps/sprint-triage/sprint-triage.yaml` only after that validation succeeds. Then fetch the Confluence page as HTML for existing-guide comparison and top-insertion context.

`ready`: validated evidence-file source data, both products, and the complete approval artifact are ready for review.
`gaps`: the collection locator or evidence file is missing, generic/tool-activity-only, malformed, outside the permitted path, unreadable, hash- or byte-count-mismatched, invalid JSON, or incomplete/unverifiable structured collection evidence; it must be recollected before planning can continue. Report the factual failed validation in `remaining`.
`handoff`: actionable planning work remains and requires no user input.
`blocked`: unsafe redaction or another user decision is required; put the question in `remaining`.

Hand-off: read/write .workflows/state/<session-key>/state.json
