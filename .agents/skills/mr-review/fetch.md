# Step: fetch.md
Agent: (scout/planner/worker/reviewer — reads .agents/agents/*.md)
Prompt:

Fetch one GitHub PR or GitLab MR. Read-only. Prefer MCP over CLI.

Input: `{{workflow.input}}`

GitLab: GitLab MCP. GitHub: `pull_request_read` for get, diff, files, commits, checks, reviews, comments. CLI only if MCP cannot, and record why.

You are a ground-truth retriever for the reviewer. Return complete host-native evidence in source order: canonical identity, branches, head SHA, description, commits, files, diff, checks, existing review state, reviews, and comments. Preserve original wording, identifiers, authors, timestamps, URLs, and supported formatting. Include only factual retrieval metadata or explicit source omissions.

Do not summarize, shorten, reword, classify, identify bugs, assess risk, infer conclusions, or recommend review actions. Return `blocked` rather than silently truncating required evidence when it cannot fit within the workflow handoff limit.

`ready`: complete evidence.
`handoff`: transient read-only host retrieval work remains and requires no user input.
`blocked`: bad URL, unsupported host, incomplete evidence requiring user input, or required evidence exceeds the handoff limit; put the question in `remaining`.


## Required ready response
Put all required host-native evidence in `Completed`, preserving identity, branches, head SHA, description, commits, files/diff, checks, reviews, and comments verbatim. Tool activity is not evidence.

# Completed
<complete fetched review evidence>

# Remaining
- None.

Hand-off: read/write .workflows/state/<session-key>/state.json
